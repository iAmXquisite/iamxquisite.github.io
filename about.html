		<h1>About Us</h1>
		  <p>Virtual  reality has been around for a long time. It is a topic that is pretty hot  recently with introductions of many forms of it. There are many that use a  screen in front of the user with glasses type wear to see the digital world in  front of them and the other way uses the world around you. The Hololens is the  one that we liked out of all of them. It is the first untethered and best  looking one out there. We all liked the idea and wanted to create a website  that were to sell software that would use the Hololens to give the user as much  freedom as they want in their own comfort, rather than being tethered and tied to an expensive computer, they could use  it freely for any activity they would like.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Each one of us wanted to work on  different things. Jiovanni wanted to work on the structure and the  HTML/(Javascript?) for the website. He made the template, editable regions and  the number of page we wanted to work with. Cesar brought up the Idea on what to  work with, looked up information about it, filled editable regions with context  and went over ideas with the group. Chris worked on the design of the site, the  color, and the actual logo for the site, arraigning the site and the look/feel  of it using Photoshop for custom logos and images we wanted to mix.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p> We all worked on every page together  after the template was done. The format and the look of it, the feel once Chris  brought the look and design for it. Jiovanni worked on any issues that came up  with collapsible regions, forms and buttons. Cesar did the grammar and spell  checking, made sure the editable regions had context and filled them with any  detail that needed to be done.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Images we got for the icons in our  pricing/experience tab were found from a free vector site, so we could scale  the images without losing the quality. The Hololens home video was found in the  Microsoft Hololens site. We found it in the site and inspected the element to  get the code for the video, put it on to our site and looped it. The Logo was  designed and made by Chris.  The font on  the log is (Font here), size (Size here). The font for our page is (Font name  here), size (size here). The font and size were taken into account for make it  readable and appealing to the user.</p>
