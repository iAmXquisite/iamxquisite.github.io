				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>Virtual reality has been around for a long time. It is a topic that is pretty hot recently with introductions of many forms of it. There are many that use a screen in front of the user with glasses type wear to see the digital world in front of them and the other way uses the world around you. The HoloLens is the one that we liked out of all of them. It is the first untethered and best looking one out there. We all liked the idea and wanted to create a website that were to sell software that would use the HoloLens to give the user as much freedom as they want in their own comfort, rather than being tethered andÂ tied to an expensive computer, they could use it freely for any activity they would like.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Each one of us wanted to work on different things. Jiovanni worked on the template structure and the HTML/JavaScript for the website. He made the template, editable regions and the number of pages we wanted to work with. Cesar looked up information about the topic, proposed content for the pages and went over ideas with the group. Chris worked on the design of the site, color scheme, and the logo for the site. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were used for the logo and images found in the experiences page.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>We all worked on every page together after the template was done. We brainstormed ideas for each page on a piece of paper and began working on them once we all agreed. Chris brought the look and design for the prices page. Jiovanni worked on the experiences page layout and pre-order page and its JavaScript functionality. Cesar did the grammar and spell checking, made sure the editable regions had content and filled them with any detail that needed to be done.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Images we got for the icons in our experience page were found in free vector sites, so we could scale the images without losing the quality. The HoloLens home video was found in the Microsoft HoloLens site. We found it in the site and inspected the element to get the code for the video. The Logo was designed and made by Chris. The fonts and font sizes were taken into account by Chris to ensure design flow, readability and appeal to the user.</p>
